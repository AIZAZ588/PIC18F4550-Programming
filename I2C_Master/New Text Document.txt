This Problem has been resolved

Here are the identified issues and their solutions:

For the Master:
1) Disable Slew Rate Control for Standard Speed mode (100 kHz and 1 MHz) by setting it to '1'.
2) There's no need to enable ACKEN for sending data.
3) Avoid sending data in a loop if RSEN (Repeated Start) is not enabled. It's good practice to call a function like 'tx_data' from another function.
4) Always double-check the address of the slave to which you want to send data.
5) If you use left shift in the address, make sure to consider it when addressing the slave.
6) Disable the Watchdog Timer (WDT) if it's not needed.
7) Enable LVP (Low Voltage Programming) if required.

For the Slave:

1) Verify the address in the slave to ensure it matches the expected address.
2) Disable Slew Rate Control for Standard Speed mode (100 kHz and 1 MHz) by setting it to '1'.
3) There's no need to use 'ACKEN' in the slave code, as the slave automatically sends ACK/NACK to the master.
4) Enable interrupts in the slave code to handle incoming data or events.
5) In the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), check if SSPOV (Receive Overflow) or WCOL (Write Collision) occur. You can connect LEDs to indicate these conditions.
6) Use clock stretching in the ISR to ensure that data is processed correctly, and release it at the end of the ISR.
7) Utilize the R_nW (Read/Write) and D_NOT_A (Data/Address) bits in the ISR to determine the operation being performed.

Important Note:

1)  Make New project: I cleaned and built the same projects again and again over 50 times and removed some files from my project in MPLAB X IDE but when I saw the folder, it was still there. 
then I created a new project and it pasted the only files I wanted to build and it worked in proteus 
2) Use Protues Debugger for  debugging
